## Stack 
### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a class-based CSS framework that allows us to style our website. It's pretty straightforward to learn, the documentation is fantastic, and you can try it yourself without downloading anything.
### React
React is a framework that allows us to create the functionality for each of our pages. To get started, be sure to check out this website
### Next JS
Next JS is built on top of React, and allows users to find our website easier via search engines like Google using a concept called Server Side Rendering or Static Site Generation (SSR or SSG). To learn more about Next JS and the concepts of SSR and SSG, check out the Next JS docs.
### Firebase
Firebase is a fantastic tool for easily managing the back-end of an application from the front-end. Firebase takes care of managing users, website analytics, as well as storing data in a NoSQL database. To get started with learning Firebase, we recommend checking out this website or watching this video. Also, be sure to check out the official Firebase YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/firebase
### Docker
To host our website, we use a tool called Docker paired with Google Cloud Run. These tools allow us to "bundle" our site (almost like we're packaging our website up into a box) and then putting that "box" on Google Cloud Run for other people to access at https://sciteens.org.
